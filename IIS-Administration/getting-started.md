# Getting started



## Requirements

The Microsoft IIS Administration API supports Windows 7 and above.

The IIS Administration API depends on .NET Core and will automatically download and install it if it is not present on the machine
* [Microsoft .NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) ([Direct Download](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/8/5/7852163D-1A56-4642-84B6-60A8537343EF/dotnet-win-x64.1.0.5.exe))

## Installing

The latest version of the Microsoft IIS Administration API is available for download [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=829373).

After installation is a perfect time to [configure](configuration/appsettings.json.md) the service for its intended purpose. To get a better idea of what the API has to offer take a look at the built-in [API explorer](api-explorer/index.md). To learn how to use the web UI at [manage.iis.net](https://manage.iis.net) read the page on [connecting to the management portal](management-portal/connecting.md)
