# CORS

[CORS](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) policies allow browser based applications to send requests to the Microsoft IIS Administration API. The CORS settings can be modified in the [appsettings.json](../configuration/appsettings.json.md) file. By default, [manage.iis.net](https://manage.iis.net) is the only origin that is allowed in the API's CORS policy.
